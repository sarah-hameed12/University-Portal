## My Role (Contributor: @sarah-hameed12)

As part of this group project, I was responsible for building several key modules and features:

- **Emails Dashboard** – enabled students to draft and send emails to professors directly from the portal, with tracking of responses and notifications.  
- **Course Memo** – implemented memo functionality for each subject, providing a personal notepad-style space.  
- **Document Hub** – created a centralized dashboard integrating multiple features.  
- **Faculty Office Hours** – developed a searchable listing of professors' office hours.  
- **Settings Page** – added user settings management.
