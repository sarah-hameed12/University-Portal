# LUMS Super Web-App

The **Super LUMS Web-App** is designed to streamline key university processes that students interact with daily. The existing university portal is often difficult to navigate due to fragmented systems, creating friction for both students and faculty.  

Our app centralizes these functionalities into a single, user-friendly platform. By integrating **academic management**, **social engagement**, and **event coordination**, it delivers a seamless digital experience tailored for the campus community. With the growing importance of **AI**, **distributed systems**, and **data-driven solutions**, this project also sets the foundation for future enhancements that make university life more efficient and connected.

## My Role (Contributor: @sarah-hameed12)

As part of this group project, I was responsible for building several key modules and features:

- **Emails Dashboard** – enabled students to draft and send emails to professors directly from the portal, with tracking of responses and notifications.  
- **Course Memo** – implemented memo functionality for each subject, providing a personal notepad-style space.  
- **Document Hub** – created a centralized dashboard integrating multiple features.  
- **Faculty Office Hours** – developed a searchable listing of professors' office hours.  
- **Settings Page** – added user settings management.
